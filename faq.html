                <h3>What is reFrame?</h3>
                <p>reFrame is an AI-powered communication coach that helps you transform emotionally charged messages into dignity-first communication. Type your raw, honest thoughts, and reFrame provides a healthier version that preserves your feelings while building connection instead of conflict.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p>Simply type the message you want to send (or wish you hadn't sent) into reFrame. Our AI, built on the R³ Framework (REGULATED, RESPECTFUL, REPAIRABLE), analyzes your message and provides a reframed version that:</p>
                <p>• Keeps your authentic feelings and needs<br>
                • Expresses them in a way that opens dialogue<br>
                • Protects dignity for both parties<br>
                • Creates space for repair and connection</p>
                <p>You can then copy the reframed message and use it in your actual conversation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
                <p>Yes. We take privacy seriously. Your messages are processed to provide the reframe, but we don't store your personal conversations long-term. See our <a href="privacy.html" style="color: #FF7F50;">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
                <p>reFrame is currently free to use while we're in beta. We're gathering feedback to make the product as helpful as possible. In the future, we'll offer both free and premium tiers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I use it on my phone?</h3>
                <p>Yes! The web version works on any device with a browser. We're also building dedicated mobile apps for iOS and Android that will launch in 2026.</p>

        <!-- About the R³ Framework -->
        <div class="faq-section">
            <h2>About the R³ Framework</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What does R³ stand for?</h3>
                <p>R³ stands for REGULATED, RESPECTFUL, REPAIRABLE—the three pillars of dignity-first communication:</p>
                <p>• <strong>REGULATED:</strong> Pause before reacting. Strong emotions are signals, not commands.<br>
                • <strong>RESPECTFUL:</strong> Protect dignity even in disagreement. Separate person from position.<br>
                • <strong>REPAIRABLE:</strong> Mistakes don't end relationships. Apologize, own impact, reconnect.</p>
                <p>Learn more on our <a href="r3-framework.html" style="color: #FF7F50;">R³ Framework page</a>.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How is this different from other communication tools?</h3>
                <p>Most tools check grammar or tone. reFrame teaches relationship psychology. We're not just making you sound nicer—we're teaching you to communicate in ways that strengthen relationships across generations. The R³ Framework is backed by decades of research on conflict resolution, psychological safety, and observational learning.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need to understand R³ to use reFrame?</h3>
                <p>Not at all! You can use reFrame without knowing anything about R³. Just type your message and get a better version. Over time, you'll naturally start noticing the patterns and internalizing the framework. Think of it as training wheels—you benefit immediately, and the learning happens organically.</p>

            <h2>About Usage</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>When should I use reFrame?</h3>
                <p>Use reFrame whenever you're about to send a message from heightened emotion—hurt, anger, frustration, disappointment. Perfect situations include:</p>
                <p>• Disagreements with your partner<br>
                • Difficult conversations with family<br>
                • Workplace conflicts<br>
                • Setting boundaries<br>
                • Responding to criticism<br>
                • Any time you think "I want to say something but I don't know how"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I use this for work emails?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! reFrame works for professional communication too. Many users find it helpful for giving feedback, addressing conflicts with colleagues, or navigating difficult conversations with managers or clients.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if I disagree with the reframe?</h3>
                <p>That's totally fine! reFrame is a suggestion, not a prescription. Use it as a starting point. You might take parts of it, rewrite sections, or use it to spark your own ideas. The goal is to help you express yourself better, not to put words in your mouth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Will this make me sound fake?</h3>
                <p>No. reFrame preserves your authentic feelings—it just helps you express them constructively. You're not pretending to feel differently; you're learning to express what you actually feel in a way that the other person can hear. That's not fake. That's skilled communication.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How often should I use it?</h3>
                <p>As often as you need! Some people use it daily, others weekly. Over time, you'll likely need it less as the R³ patterns become natural to you. That's the goal—we want you to outgrow the tool.</p>
            </div>

        <!-- About the Philosophy -->
        <div class="faq-section">
            <h2>About the Philosophy</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's the science behind this?</h3>
                <p>The R³ Framework is built on decades of research:</p>
                <p>• <strong>Conflict Resolution (NIH):</strong> Avoiding conflict harms relationships more than addressing it constructively<br>
                • <strong>Psychological Safety (Harvard):</strong> Teams with high psychological safety show better performance<br>
                • <strong>Observational Learning (Bandura):</strong> Children learn behaviors by watching parents model them<br>
                • <strong>Repair Research (Gottman):</strong> Successful relationships are repair-rich, not conflict-free</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why "generational cycles"?</h3>
                <p>Children don't inherit beliefs—they inherit nervous systems. When they watch how parents handle conflict during the first 10 years of life, those patterns become their blueprint. By modeling R³ communication, you're teaching the next generation how to navigate disagreement healthily. That's how cycles break.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is this just therapy?</h3>
                <p>No, reFrame is not therapy and doesn't replace professional mental health support. Think of it as a communication coach—we help you express yourself better in specific moments. Therapy addresses deeper patterns, trauma, and mental health. Both can be valuable, and they complement each other.</p>

            <h2>Technical Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What AI does this use?</h3>
                <p>reFrame is powered by Claude Sonnet 4, developed by Anthropic. We've specifically trained our prompts around the R³ Framework to ensure every reframe embodies REGULATED, RESPECTFUL, REPAIRABLE communication.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I save my conversations?</h3>
                <p>Currently, messages are not saved automatically (to protect your privacy). We're building features to let users optionally save their reframes and track their progress over time. This will be opt-in—you'll always control your data.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is there a limit to how much I can use it?</h3>
                <p>While we're in beta, reFrame is free with no usage limits. When we launch paid tiers, there will be a free version with reasonable limits and a premium version with unlimited use.</p>
